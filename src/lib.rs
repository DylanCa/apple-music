//
//! This crate provides a convenient way of controlling a MacOS Apple Music player, fully through Rust code.
//! The logic behind this crate relies on Apple's scripting APIs through [`osascript` CLI](https://ss64.com/mac/osascript.html) and `JavaScript` scripts.
//
//! ## Installation
//! `apple-music` is available directly on crates.io:
//! ```shell
//! cargo add apple-music
//! ```
//
//! ## How-to
//! Import the library in your project:
//! ```rust
//! use apple-music::AppleMusic;
//! ```
//
//! The library entry point is `AppleMusic`. From there, you can:
//! - Get the application's data - `AppleMusic::get_application_data();` -> `ApplicationData`
//! - Get the current track - `AppleMusic::get_current_track();` -> `Track`
//!   - Track can then be used directly:
//!     - Love / dislike Track - `track.set_loved(true);` or `track.set_disliked(true);`
//!     - Download Track - `track.download()`
//!     - Reveal Track in Player - `track.reveal_in_player()`
//
//
//! - Get the current playlist - `AppleMusic::get_current_playlist();` -> `Playlist`
//!   - Playlist can then be used directly:
//!     - Search for a track in a playlist - `playlist.search_for_tracks(track_name)` -> `Vec<Track>`
//!     - Reveal Playlist in player - `playlist.reveal_in_player()`
//!     - Download Playlist - `playlist.download()`
//
//! To control the player, you can do it directly using `AppleMusic`:
//! - Set the volume - `AppleMusic::set_sound_volume(50);`
//! - Change track - `AppleMusic::next_track();`
//! - Play specific Track - `AppleMusic::play_track(Track);`
//! - Pause - `AppleMusic::pause();`
//! - Quit the application - `AppleMusic::quit();`
//
//
//! That is just a part of the available API, without even mentioning the data you have access to.
//
//! For more info and an exhaustive list of what's available, please check out the [documentation](https://docs.rs/apple-music/latest)!
//
//
//! ## Example
//! ```rust
//! let playlist = &AppleMusic::get_playlist_by_id(1234).unwrap();
//! AppleMusic::play_playlist(playlist); //! Apple Music player starts playing provided Playlist.
//
//! AppleMusic::set_shuffle(true); //! Shuffle is now enabled on currently playing Playlist.
//
//! let track = playlist.fetch_playlist_tracks().unwrap()[5];
//! AppleMusic::play_track(track); //! Apple Music player starts playing provided Track.
//
//! let current_track = AppleMusic::get_current_track().unwrap();
//! println!("{}", current_track.name()); //! "An awesome song!"
//
//! println!("{}", current_track.artwork_url()); //! Prints the direct url for the Artwork of the Track.
//
//! current_track.set_loved(true); //! Track is now loved!
//
//! AppleMusic::next_track(); //! Goes to next track.
//
//! let current_track = AppleMusic::get_current_track().unwrap();
//! current_track.reveal_in_player(); //! Track is revealed and selected on Apple Music player.
//
//! current_track.set_disliked(true); //! Track is now disliked!
//
//! AppleMusic::set_sound_volume(15); //! Sets Player volume to 15.
//
//! playlist.download(); //! Playlist is being downloaded on Apple Music player.
//
//! AppleMusic::quit(); //! Quit Apple Music application on Mac.
//! ```
//
//! ## Limitations
//! ### Platforms
//! This crate only works on MacOs, and has only been tested with macOS 13.4.1 and Apple Music 1.3.5.
//
//! I would be more than happy provide support for other version of MacOs / Apple Music, do not hesitate to open an issue if you are facing failures!
//
//! ## Next Steps
//! _Before v1.0:_
//! - Finish to add remaining classes & methods:
//!   - `ADD()`
//!   - `EXPORT()`
//!   - `REFRESH()`
//!   - Ensure the whole API is covered by this crate
